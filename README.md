This repository showcases professional resumes I’ve created for clients. I focus on industry-standard, ATS-optimized resumes that clearly present your experience and impact.

## Book a Resume
- Fiverr: [Order your resume](https://www.fiverr.com/s/pdvxwLY)

PDF is the preferred industry standard because it preserves layout and opens easily. DOCX works too, but most employers prefer PDF for consistency.
